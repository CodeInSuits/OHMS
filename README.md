#OnLibraryWalk

A tinder-like product targeted at all UCSD students who are troubled with the lack of systematical and detailed information about students’ organizations and on-campus events. Its solution will also enable students’ organizations to stop wasting money and time printing flyers which are severely environmental-unfriendly. This application will also enable people be aware of the detailed location of each organization or vendor on site during the events they go to to increase the efficiency and mobility of the event using interaction between organizor and attendant. 

This project can be broadened into benefiting all sorts of events that still need physical copy.


TO BE CONTIUED....

All file will be updated once the project is moduled.
